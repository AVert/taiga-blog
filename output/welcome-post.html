    <p>First of all, thank you very much for trying Taiga. We have been developing this platform for nearly 3 years now. It all started with our first PIWEEK (our week-long hackathon that we carry every six months). Kaleidos, were employees have been developing this free &amp; open source  platform, was very much in its infancy, but even in this early and fragile state we were all committed to enjoying every day of our work no matter the consequences.</p>
<p>Our clients are Internet startups or big corporations that want to launch something disruptive (startup-like) so normally we get a great “WHAT TO DO”. We also have a very talented team of happy coders and designers that feel that free &amp; open source is the best way to build great software a greater community, so we also had a promising “WHO WILL DO IT”. Taiga is our answer to “HOW WE DO IT”. Because when you need fast-paced development, an obsession with failing fast, a need for transparency and the certainty that a bunch of unique individuals, if given the tools and the culture, can become the most successful team on the planet, not every methodology or platform will suffice.</p>
<p>So here is Taiga. We borrowed the name from the spectacular boreal forests. In our minds, they presented a faithful metaphor for projects in general. They look stunning and beautiful from the outside but if you delve in unprepared they become pitiless and deadly. We didn’t want people to just “survive” the taiga, we wanted to enjoy the taiga once they were fully within. That was our challenge.</p>
<p>You will see a friendly and beautiful interface, geek references and a bias towards allowing people to feel that they are the ones in control, not the project. We have tried to bring the best of us to Taiga, both technically and emotionally. We have had incredible support from our clients and friends, always asking us to release it to the public. Well, here you are, take it, play with it, gives us feedback, be part of the Taiga community and help us change the way projects are managed and developed.</p>
<p>What should you expect from us now? In the short term, we will fix bugs, add little nice features,  listen to your feedback and try to stay calm :) For 2015 we are preparing a major set of features that will blow your mind and change the way to manage projects forever so that when you look back to Taiga’s original release, you will nod and say “Oh, yes… this is dwarfing even that first Taiga release”.</p>
